<p>My dog loves to play, but sometimes he can be a bit lazy. Today I took him to the park, but he just wanted to sleep under a tree.</p><p>We go to the beach every summer. It's always a fun time. The children build sandcastles and swim in the sea. Last year we even saw dolphins in the water!</p><p>Cooking is one of my hobbies. I often try out new recipes. Yesterday I made a cake, but I forgot to add the sugar, so it wasn't sweet enough.</p>
